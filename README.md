# installtemplate
A very appealing command line template to download something
<h3>How to use: </h3>

<p>First you are going to need Visual Studio so download that then download .Net 4.7.2(Search up how to download it)<br/>Then you are going to need to make a new project then when you are making the project make sure you look for | .NET FRAMEWORK CONSOLE APPLICATION | so you can make it into a exe.. Now you should see some code replace that with the code on here then edit it how you like then click build on the top then click BUILD PROJECTNAME then go into the file directory of where the project is then you should fine the exe inside of the bin folder :D DM me on discord for further help
